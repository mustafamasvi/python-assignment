    "**Description:** A board full of overturned cards. There is a pair for each card. The player flips over two cards. If they match, then they stay overturned. Otherwise they flip back. The player needs to overturn all the cards in the fewest moves to win.\n",

    "- Class constructor will create a 6 by 6 game board. You should choose the alphabets randomly and assign them randomly to each cell of the game board. Remember that each random letter should appear in exaxt two game cells. \n",
    "- Write a class function ``play_game`` that accepts two index values and plays the game. If the character values in selected cells are equal thencards will overturned. \n",
    "- Write a class function ``display`` that shows the current state of the game. Initially all cells are showing just numerical values. Look at sample run to understand the initial state of the game. \n",
